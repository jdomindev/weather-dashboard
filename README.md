# <Weather-Dashboard>
## Description
- This project was a weather dashboard that utilizes data fetched from an API call OpenWeatherMap.
- The weather dashboard helped me to learn about fetching data from an api and then utilizing that data in my document in a dynamic way.
- It also gave me more practice with bootstrap classes and the overall structure of how I lay out my javascript functions.
